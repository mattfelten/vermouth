## Vermouth
### A scss skeleton using [Bourbon](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon) and [Bourbon Neat](https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat)
Start projects faster. There's a few mixins and whatnot that I think are useful that don't belong into Bourbon.

### Install
Install with [Bower](http://bower.io/): `bower install --save mattfelten/vermouth`
